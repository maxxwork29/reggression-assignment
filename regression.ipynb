Scaling (such as standardization) allows you to interpret and compare the relative importance of predictors more easily.\n",

Scaling helps ensure that all variables contribute more equally to the model fitting process.\n",

Scaling ensures consistent and meaningful interpretation, especially when variables are rescaled for practical or theoretical reasons.\n",
